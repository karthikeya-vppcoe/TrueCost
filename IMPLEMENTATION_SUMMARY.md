#### Technical Implementation
- Created `ShoppingListView.tsx` component (450+ lines)
- Added 3 new TypeScript interfaces (ShoppingListItem, PriceHistoryPoint, PriceAlertNotification)
- Implemented mock API endpoints with realistic data
- Integrated with existing user dashboard navigation
- Added 6 sample items with 30-day price history

#### User Experience Features
- Summary statistics cards (Total Items, Potential Savings, Active Alerts, High Priority)
- Price drop notifications banner with latest 3 alerts
- Interactive line charts for each item's price history
- Color-coded priority badges with smooth animations
- Empty state with call-to-action button
- Responsive grid layout for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Toast notifications for user actions
